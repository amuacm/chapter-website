[P]ostgr[e]SQL | [R]eact JS | Djan[g]o 

These are the technologies have been utilized in AMU's Spring 2024 Web/Mobile Development Class, and this project has been assigned as the final project for the course.

## Design
Currently, the site uses a single page layout, in order to simplify end-user experience (and developer experience). The color scheme models the ACM and also Ave Maria University's academic colors.
